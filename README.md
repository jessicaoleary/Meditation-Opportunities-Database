## Project Goals

In a world increasingly reliant on digital resources, the value and importance of communal meditation experiences cannot be overstated, particularly for those new to the practice. While meditation apps offer convenience, they often lack the depth and connection found in group settings. However, for many, accessing local meditation opportunities remains a challenge, especially for newcomers navigating an unfamiliar landscape. With this in mind, the aim of the project is clear: to bridge this gap and make local meditation opportunities more accessible by consolidating information in one easily accessible platform. To achieve this goal, the project will focus on developing an online database dedicated to cataloging meditation opportunities throughout the Charlottesville area. By compiling comprehensive information and providing user-friendly search and filtering functionalities, the database seeks to empower individuals to explore and engage with meditation practices in their community with ease and confidence.

### Objectives
1. **Research and Data Compilation:** Conduct research to gather comprehensive information on meditation groups, centers, and events in the Charlottesville area. Compile this data, including details such as location, type of meditation, schedule, and contact information, to populate the database.

2. **Website Development:** Design and develop a user-friendly website interface for accessing the online database. This includes creating features for searching, filtering, and browsing meditation opportunities, as well as integrating a calendar view option.

3. **Content Population:** Populate the database with accurate and up-to-date listings of meditation opportunities. Ensure that all information is consistent, complete, and relevant to users' needs.

4. **Testing and Quality Assurance:** Conduct thorough testing of the website's functionality, usability, and performance across different devices and browsers. Address any issues or bugs identified during testing to ensure a smooth user experience.

5. **Launch and Promotion:** Prepare promotional materials and marketing strategies to raise awareness of the online database within the Charlottesville community. Launch the database on the scheduled date (July 4, 2024) and promote its availability to attract users.

6. **Post-Launch Evaluation and Follow-Up:** Conduct post-launch evaluation to assess the performance and usability of the online database. Address any immediate issues or bugs identified during the evaluation period. Continue to engage with the meditation community, perform routine technical maintenance, and update the database with new information as needed.
